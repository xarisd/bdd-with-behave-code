## Run behave

The minimum requirement for a features directory is:

```
features/
features/everything.feature
features/steps/
features/steps/steps.py
```

Run behave

```
behave
```

Tip: If youâ€™re having trouble setting things up and want to see what behave is doing in attempting to find your features use the `-v` (verbose) command-line switch.
